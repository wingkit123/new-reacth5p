In fact, only about 5% of Malaysians have any estate plan, leaving roughly RM65 billion (US$15 b) in unclaimed assets with the government. Superstitions and taboos around death make people reluctant to draft wills, and many simply lack awareness. Islamic teachings explicitly encourage planning one\u2019s legacy \u2013 as the Prophet taught, \u201cto leave your inheritors wealthy rather than leave them poor\u201d. Estate planning isn\u2019t just for the rich: it ensures your family is cared for and avoids legal disputes. For example, Malaysian experts stress that every asset owner should plan their estate now \u2013 \u201cusing instruments such as \u2026 wills\u201d \u2013 because this yields \u201cmore efficient results\u201d and avoids complications later.<\/p><p>A will ensures your home and assets go to loved ones, not the state. Interactive modules (quizzes, videos, timelines) can teach these concepts in bite-sized form.<\/p><p>Critical facts (Malaysia): Less than 5% of people have an estate plan. Without a will, assets follow rigid statutes: e.g. by the Distribution Act, parents\/spouse\/children inherit in fixed shares (and if none survive, the estate reverts to the state). Banks and the trustee (Amanah Raya) handle estates of those who die intestate, often after lengthy court processes.<\/p><p>Cultural barriers: Many Malaysians avoid the topic of death. Studies cite cultural taboos and superstition as barriers, causing procrastination on will-writing. Agents can stress that planning is an act of responsibility, not bad luck.<\/p><p>Religious perspective: For Muslims, Shariah law (faraid) prescribes default inheritance shares. A Muslim may only will up to 1\/3 of their estate to non-heirs (beyond that all heirs must agree). Education should clarify that wasiat (Islamic wills), hibah (gifts) and waqf (endowments) are valid tools under Malaysian law. In fact, Islamic scholars urge planning: a Muslim \u201cshould not have anything that can be bequeathed for two nights without having his will written\u201d. Emphasize that estate planning is permitted and recommended in Islam, aligning with values of fairness and charity.<\/p><p>Conventional vs Islamic Estate Planning<\/p><p>Estate planning rules differ by faith. To educate users, separate modules can contrast conventional (Civil law) and Islamic (Shariah law) scenarios:<\/p><p>Conventional (Non-Muslim) estate planning: Non-Muslims generally have full freedom to distribute assets via a will. If a will is made, they can leave property to anyone (subject to laws against unduly disinheriting dependents). If no will exists, the Distribution Act applies: typically spouses, children and parents inherit in statutory shares. For example, if one dies leaving only a spouse and children, the spouse gets 1\/3 and the children split 2\/3. If someone dies intestate with no immediate family, the government ultimately inherits. Module ideas: Interactive quizzes can challenge users on \u201cWhat happens if X dies without a will?\u201d and explain the Distribution Act scenarios.<\/p><p>Islamic estate planning: Explain that faraid (Islamic inheritance law) normally governs a Muslim\u2019s estate. A short video or timeline could illustrate how fixed Quranic shares (e.g. wife 1\/4 or 1\/8, children 2:1 son:daughter) are applied. Emphasize that a Muslim\u2019s written will (wasiat) is limited to 1\/3 of the estate for non-heirs. Use flashcards or drag\u2011and\u2011drop exercises to teach terms like \u201cfaraid\u201d, \u201cwasiat\u201d, \u201chibah\u201d (gift) and \u201cwaqf\u201d. Incorporate religious motivation: cite the Prophet\u2019s advice to plan ahead and highlight Malaysia\u2019s Shariah court resources.<\/p>"},"library":"H5P.AdvancedText 1.1","metadata":{"license":"U","title":"Transcription"},"subContentId":"4bfe3f57-d0ab-4965-b217-d81717a567dc"},"useSeparator":"auto"}]},"library":"H5P.Column 1.18","subContentId":"e8e0e802-b1be-4c6b-8190-91048f2509c6","metadata":{"title":"Course","license":"U"}},{"params":{"content":[{"content":{"params":{"panels":[{"content":{"params":{"text":"Estate planning is the process of arranging for the management and disposal of a person's estate during their life and after death.

This neglect results in approximately RM65 billion (US$15 billion) in unclaimed assets. Cultural superstitions and a lack of awareness contribute to this issue, despite Islamic teachings encouraging legacy planning.<\/p><h3>Role of Wills<\/h3><p>Creating a will is essential to ensure that assets are passed on to loved ones rather than the state. Interactive educational modules can effectively convey the significance of wills and estate planning to consumers.<\/p><h3>Cultural and Religious Barriers<\/h3><p>Cultural taboos surrounding death hinder discussions about estate planning. Agents can emphasize that planning is a responsible act, countering superstitions. For Muslims, Shariah law outlines specific inheritance rules, and education should clarify the validity of Islamic wills and other planning tools.<\/p><h3>Conventional vs Islamic Estate Planning<\/h3><p>Estate planning differs between non-Muslims and Muslims in Malaysia. Non-Muslims have the freedom to distribute assets as they wish, while Muslims must adhere to faraid, which dictates fixed shares. Educational modules can illustrate these differences and the implications of dying intestate.<\/p><h3>Educational Strategies for Agents<\/h3><p>Insurance agents can utilize interactive quizzes, videos, and flashcards to educate married couples about estate planning. These tools can clarify the consequences of not having a will and the importance of understanding both conventional and Islamic estate planning rules.<\/p>\n "},"library":"H5P.AdvancedText 1.1","metadata":{"license":"U","title":"Summary"},"subContentId":"45f3142a-9853-4467-bf00-30f8a90802fa"},"useSeparator":"auto"}]},"library":"H5P.Column 1.18","subContentId":"efa690c5-1992-4cd5-8f7d-e71fa601e935","metadata":{"title":"Summary","license":"U"}}],"behaviour":{"baseColor":"#1768c4","defaultTableOfContents":true,"progressIndicators":true,"progressAuto":true,"displaySummary":true},"read":"Read","displayTOC":"Display &#039;Table of contents&#039;","hideTOC":"Hide &#039;Table of contents&#039;","nextPage":"Next page","previousPage":"Previous page","chapterCompleted":"Page completed!","partCompleted":"@pages of @total completed","incompleteChapter":"Incomplete page","navigateToTop":"Navigate to the top","markAsFinished":"I have finished this page","fullscreen":"Fullscreen","exitFullscreen":"Exit fullscreen","bookProgressSubtext":"@count of @total pages","interactionsProgressSubtext":"@count of @total interactions","submitReport":"Submit Report","restartLabel":"Restart","summaryHeader":"Summary","allInteractions":"All interactions","unansweredInteractions":"Unanswered interactions","scoreText":"@score \/ @maxscore","leftOutOfTotalCompleted":"@left of @max interactions completed","noInteractions":"No interactions","score":"Score","summaryAndSubmit":"Summary &amp; submit","noChapterInteractionBoldText":"You have not interacted with any pages.","noChapterInteractionText":"You have to interact with at least one page before you can see the summary.","yourAnswersAreSubmittedForReview":"Your answers are submitted for review!","bookProgress":"Book progress","interactionsProgress":"Interactions progress","totalScoreLabel":"Total score","a11y":{"progress":"Page @page of @total.","menu":"Toggle navigation menu"}}
