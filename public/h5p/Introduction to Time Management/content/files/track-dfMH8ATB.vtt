00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:02.079
Time management

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.380
Introduction to time management.

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:09.239
After completing this lesson.

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:12.390
You will be able to explain what time management is.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.190
You'll be able to discuss why good time management is important,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.000
and you'll be able to identify common time management challenges.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.370
Time management is the process of planning,

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.409
organizing,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.069
and prioritizing how you use your time.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.530
It involves making conscious choices about what you do

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:32.770
and when you do it,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.270
staying focused on the task at hand

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.490
and getting important tasks done.

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:41.290
Time management is important because it reduces stress,

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.330
increases productivity,

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:45.650
improves focus and decision making,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.540
and enhances work quality.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.250
It can help you stay motivated and energetic at work,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.889
making your professional life more successful and fulfilling.

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:58.220
It also helps prevent unnecessary delays that

00:00:58.221 --> 00:01:00.209
can affect other members of your team.

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:02.130
The increased energy,

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:03.119
efficiency,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.459
and satisfaction at work can also help create more

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.849
free time for other life tasks and meaningful activities.

00:01:10.339 --> 00:01:14.569
This contributes to better work-life balance and overall quality of life.

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.949
In this way,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.110
it's essential for creating lives that reflect our values and goals.

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:21.190
However,

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:25.519
effective time management is a skill that doesn't come naturally to everyone.

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:29.489
There are 4 common types of challenges that can

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.360
get in the way of good time management,

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:32.569
procrastination.

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:34.730
Distractions

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.099
Lack of planning and prioritization.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.430
And mental barriers.

00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:43.620
Procrastination

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:51.610
Procrastination is delaying important tasks until pressure forces us to act.

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:54.860
People tend to procrastinate when they are feeling overwhelmed,

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:56.500
uncertain about where to start,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.709
or are afraid that they will fail at the task.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.819
Sometimes people procrastinate by doing less urgent tasks before important ones,

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.849
but in the long run,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.010
procrastination increases stress,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.490
worsens work quality,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.059
and creates a cycle of guilt that makes future time management harder.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.000
Distractions

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.080
Frequent distractions train the brain to have shallow focus.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.720
this makes it harder to engage in deep productive work.

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:34.679
The time spent to regain focus on a task can add up and reduce overall productivity.

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:37.330
Distractions come in many forms.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.649
They can be digital like phone notifications,

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:40.289
messages,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.479
or social media.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.160
They can also be environmental,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.199
such as background noise or clutter,

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:46.520
and they can be social,

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.600
like interruptions from co-workers or family members.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.610
Distractions can be especially common in environments where

00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:54.889
people have to constantly respond to others,

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.889
switch tasks,

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.289
or react to crises.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.910
Lack of planning and prioritization.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.600
Planning and prioritization are important aspects of time management.

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:08.550
Without them,

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.220
too much time can get easily lost or spent on the wrong things.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.429
Instead of making steady progress toward goals,

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:19.279
you might find yourself constantly scrambling to get things done at the last minute

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:21.660
or reacting to urgent crises.

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:25.789
A lack of planning and prioritization can appear in many ways,

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:26.699
such as

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.360
or time estimation,

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:30.940
unrealistic scheduling and over committing,

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.020
starting tasks without knowing what comes next,

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.580
multitasking without finishing anything,

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.580
and focusing on what's urgent instead of what's important.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.869
And mental barriers.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.919
Mental barriers that can present a challenge to time management include

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:51.160
anxiety,

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:54.850
which can lead to avoidance and interrupt getting through tasks,

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:55.679
burnout,

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.919
which drains the energy needed to plan and focus,

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.520
perfectionism,

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.679
which can make tasks take longer than anticipated,

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:06.720
or prevent someone from starting in the first place,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.320
and chronic stress,

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.289
which reduces the cognitive flexibility needed to organize or complete tasks.

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:14.529
Additionally,

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.450
people who have ADHD are on the autism spectrum,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.940
or have other neurological differences,

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:24.940
can struggle with things like initiating or switching between tasks,

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:27.660
maintaining focus and time awareness.
